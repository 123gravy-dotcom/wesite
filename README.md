<section id="about">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I enjoy gaming, watching sci-fi shows, and creating playlists on Spotify. Technology is part of all these interests—games rely on design and coding, shows use special effects, and Spotify’s interface is built by developers. My curiosity in how things work sparked my love for tech design.</p>

<section id="careers">
  <h2>Careers and Pathways</h2>
  <p>In Unit 1, we built spaghetti bridges in teams. I used teamwork, planning, and creative thinking skills. I learned how essential communication is and developed my design and testing skills. The project showed me how real tech careers—like Structural Engineering or Civil Engineering—rely on these same skills. I’m most interested in becoming a Product Designer because I enjoy designing things like shoes or tech gadgets.</p>

<section id="design">
  <h2>Technological Design Fundamentals</h2>
  <p>In the Car Design project, I learned the value of the design process: from setting a clear goal, researching, sketching ideas, planning materials, and building models. It taught me that rushing into building doesn’t work—you need thoughtful steps to succeed in design.</p>

<section id="skills">
  <h2>Technological Design Skills</h2>
  <p>This unit included a mood board (Canva), tiny home (Homestyler), skateboard (TinkerCAD/OnShape), and sneaker design. Canva helped organize visuals. Homestyler let me design 3D rooms. TinkerCAD and OnShape were great for modeling. I learned how each tool supports creativity differently, and how taking pictures and writing reflections helps improve designs.</p>

<section id="environment">
  <h2>Technology, The Environment, and Society</h2>
  <p>The Upholstered Footrest project helped me see why eco-friendly materials matter. Reusing materials reduces waste. It also showed me how new technology is influenced by environmental needs. Things like energy-efficient homes or sustainable sneakers show how tech evolves to help both society and nature.</p>

<section id="safety">
  <h2>Health and Safety</h2>
  <p>All semester, I followed safety rules when using sharp tools, hot glue guns, and in online programs. Once, I forgot safety goggles while testing a piece—I corrected it by stopping work and putting them on. Safety protects everyone and helps us work with focus and confidence.</p>
